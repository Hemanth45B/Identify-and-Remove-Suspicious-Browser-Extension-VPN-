Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extension(VPN)
# Project: VPN Setup and Analysis

## Objective

This project aims to understand the function of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in safeguarding online privacy and enabling secure communication.

## Tools Used

* **VPN Service:** ProtonVPN (Free Tier)
* **IP Verification:** whatismyipaddress.com

## Setup and Verification Process

The following steps were performed to set up and verify the VPN connection:

1.  **VPN Selection and Registration:** The free tier of a reputable VPN service, ProtonVPN, was selected and an account was created on their official website.
2.  **Client Installation:** The ProtonVPN client software for the operating system was downloaded and installed.
3.  **Establishing a Connection:** The client was launched and after logging in, a connection was established to the nearest available server to ensure optimal speed.
4.  **IP Address Verification:** The user's original IP address was noted before connecting to the VPN. After connecting, the public IP address was confirmed to have changed to one assigned by the VPN server. The new IP address shown in the report is `185.159.157.14`, located in Zurich, Switzerland.
5.  **Encrypted Browsing Test:** Several websites were browsed to confirm that internet traffic was being correctly routed through the VPN tunnel.
6.  **Performance Comparison:** After disconnecting from the VPN, the IP address reverted to the original one
